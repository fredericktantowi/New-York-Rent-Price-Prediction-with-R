This project aims to develop a machine learning model to predict rental prices for Airbnb listings in New York City. The model will leverage various factors that influence pricing decisions, helping potential hosts optimize their listings and guests estimate costs effectively.

Data Preprocessing:

        Clean and format the Airbnb data in R, handling missing values and outliers.
        Engineer new features if necessary (e.g., combining features, deriving categorical variables).
        Prepare the data for machine learning modeling by splitting it into training and testing sets.
        
Exploratory Data Analysis:
        Analyze the distribution of rental prices and identify factors potentially influencing pricing (e.g., location, room type, amenities).
        Visualize these relationships using appropriate charts and graphs.
        
Feature Selection:

        Identify the most relevant features that contribute significantly to predicting rental prices. This may involve techniques like correlation analysis or feature importance scores.

Model Development:

        Train a Random Forest regression model on the prepared data. Random Forest is chosen due to its effectiveness in handling a variety of data types and its inherent resistance to overfitting.
        Tune the model's hyperparameters to optimize its performance.
    
Model Evaluation:

        Evaluate the model's performance on the testing set using metrics like Mean Squared Error (MSE) or R-squared.
        Consider alternative models (e.g., Linear Regression, Gradient Boosting) for comparison, if desired.


Expected Outcomes:

    Develop a reliable machine learning model to predict Airbnb rental prices in New York City.
    Gain insights into the most important factors influencing Airbnb rental pricing.
    Provide a valuable tool for Airbnb hosts to optimize their listing prices and guests to estimate rental costs accurately.

Software and Tools:

    R programming language
    Data manipulation libraries (e.g., dplyr, tidyr)
    Data visualization libraries (e.g., ggplot2)
    Machine learning libraries (e.g., caret, randomForest)

Project Significance:

    This project can empower both Airbnb hosts and guests. Hosts can leverage the model's predictions to set competitive prices that maximize their earnings. Guests can utilize the model to estimate rental costs accurately, informing their budgeting and accommodation selection process.
